# Telcoin Network
The Telcoin Network is a distributed network of computers that participate in consensus to finalize EVM-style blocks.

## Execution Layer
The execution layer contains the RPC and block production. It is based of `reth`'s open-source project.

## Consensus Layer
The consensus layer uses Bullshark and Narwhal mempools to finalize a collection of transactions for the next EVM block.
